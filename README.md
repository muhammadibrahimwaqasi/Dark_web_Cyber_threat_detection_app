The model folder is not included in this repository to keep the repo size manageable.

Before running the project for the first time, create a folder named model in the root directory.

The machine learning model will be trained and saved in this folder.

To train the model, run the following command:

python train_model.py


(Here, train_model.py is the script responsible for training the model.)

This setup ensures that anyone who clones or downloads the project can easily train and use the model without manually creating folders.

Make sure you have all required dependencies installed before training the model.

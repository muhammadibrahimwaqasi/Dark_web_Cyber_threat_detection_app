The model folder is not included in this repository to keep the repo size manageable.

When you run the project for the first time, the model folder will be created automatically in the root directory.

The machine learning model will be trained and saved in this folder.

This setup ensures that anyone who clones or downloads the project can easily train and use the model without manually creating folders.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed before training the model.
